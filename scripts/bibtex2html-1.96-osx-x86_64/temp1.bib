abstract = {This research used the common decomposition of the velocity and pressure in an average part and a fluctuating part, for high Reynolds number, of the Navier-Stokes equation, which leads to the classic problem of turbulent closure. The Prandtl's mixing length model, based on the Boussinesq hypothesis and traditionally used for free shear flows, was chosen and adapted for internal flows to solve the closure problem. For channel flows, Johann Nikuradse proposed a model for the Prandtl mixing length. In the present paper, which has an academic character, the authors made a return to the model of the mixing length of Prandtl and the model of Nikuradse, to solve turbulent flows inside a plane channel. It was possible to develop an ordinary differential model for the velocity in the direction of the flow whose solution occurs computationally in a simple but extremely accurate way when compared with Direct Numerical Simulation databases. For the viscous stress on the wall, it was possible to determine the exact mathematical solution of the ordinary differential equation. It is a model of great academic value and even to be used as reference for verification of computational codes destined to the solution of complete numerical and computational models.},

abstract = {Memory and network bandwidth are decisive bottlenecks when handling high-resolution multidimensional data sets in visualization applications, and they increasingly demand suitable data compression strategies. We introduce a novel lossy compression algorithm for {\$}N{\$}-dimensional data over regular grids. It leverages the higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD), a generalization of the SVD to 3 and more dimensions, together with adaptive quantization, run-length and arithmetic coding to store the HOSVD transform coefficients' relative positions as sorted by their absolute magnitude. Our scheme degrades the data particularly smoothly and outperforms other state-of-the-art volume compressors at low-to-medium bit rates, as required in data archiving and management for visualization purposes. Further advantages of the proposed algorithm include extremely fine bit rate selection granularity, bounded resulting {\$}l{\^{}}2{\$} error, and the ability to manipulate data at very small cost in the compression domain, for example to reconstruct subsampled or filtered-resampled versions of all (or selected parts) of the data set.},

@article{Ballouz2018,
abstract = {The defining characteristic of highly turbulent flows is the net directed transport of energy from the injection scales to the dissipation scales. This cascade is typically described in Fourier space, obscuring its connection to the mechanics of the flow. Here, we recast the energy cascade in mechanical terms, noting that for some scales to transfer energy to others, they must do mechanical work on them. This work can be expressed as the inner product of a turbulent stress and a rate of strain. But, as with all inner products, the relative alignment of these two tensors matters, and determines how strong the energy transfer will be. We show that this tensor alignment behaves very differently in two and three dimensions; in particular, the tensor eigenvalues affect the inner product in very different ways. By comparing the observed energy flux to the maximum possible if the tensors were in perfect alignment, we define an efficiency for the energy cascade. Using data from a direct numerical simulation of isotropic turbulence, we show that this efficiency is perhaps surprisingly low, with an average value of approximately 25 {\%} in the inertial range, although it is spatially heterogeneous. Our results have implications for how the stress and strain-rate magnitudes influence the flux of energy between scales, and may help to explain why the energy cascades in two and three dimensions are different.},

abstract = {The causative factors leading to the Reynolds shear stress distribution in turbulent channel flow are analysed via a backward particle path analysis. It is found that the classical displacement transport mechanism, by which changes in the mean velocity field over a mixing time correlate with the wall-normal velocity, is the dominant source of Reynolds shear stress. Approximately 20 {\%} of channel flow at any given time contains fluid motions that contribute to displacement transport. Much rarer events provide a small but non-negligible contribution to the Reynolds shear stress due to fluid particle accelerations and long-lived correlations deriving from structural features of the near-wall flow. The Reynolds shear stress in channel flow is shown to be a non-local phenomenon that is not conducive to description via a local model and particularly one depending directly on the local mean velocity gradient.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the use of high-power light-emitting diode (LED) illumination for tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV) as an alternative to traditional laser-based illumination. Modern solid-state LED devices can provide averaged radiant power in excess of 10 W and by operating the LED with short high current pulses theoretical pulse energies up to several tens of mJ can be achieved. In the present work, a custom-built drive circuit is used to drive a Luminus PT-120 high-power LED at pulsed currents of up to 150 A and 1 mu s duration. Volumetric illumination is achieved by directly projecting the LED into the flow to produce a measurement volume of approximate to 3-4 times the size of the LED die. The feasibility of the volumetric LED illumination is assessed by performing tomographic PIV of homogenous, grid-generated turbulence. Two types of LEDs are investigated, and the results are compared with measurements of the same flow using pulsed Nd:YAG laser illumination and DNS data of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The quality of the results is similar for both investigated LEDs with no significant difference between the LED and Nd:YAG illumination. Compared with the DNS, some differences are observed in the power spectra and the probability distributions of the fluctuating velocity and velocity gradients. These differences are attributed to the limited spatial resolution of the experiments and noise introduced during the tomographic reconstruction (i.e. ghost particles). The uncertainty in the velocity measurements associated with the LED illumination is estimated to approximately 0.2-0.3 pixel for both LEDs, which compares favourably with similar tomographic PIV measurements of turbulent flows. In conclusion, the proposed high-power, pulsed LED volume illumination provides accurate and reliable tomographic PIV measurements in water and presents a promising technique for flow diagnostics and velocimetry.},

Using laboratory experiments as well as numerical and analytical calculations, we explore how particle rotation depends upon particle shape. We find that shape strongly affects orientational trajectories, but that it has negligible effect on the variance of the particle angular velocity. Previous work has shown that shape significantly affects the variance of the tumbling rate of axisymmetric particles. It follows that shape affects the spinning rate in a way that is, on average, complementary to the shape-dependence of the tumbling rate. We confirm this relationship using direct numerical simulations, showing how tumbling rate and spinning rate variances show complementary trends for rod-shaped and disk-shaped particles. We also consider a random but non-turbulent flow. This allows us to explore which of the features observed for rotation in turbulent flow are due to the effects of particle alignment in vortex tubes.},

Since the celebrated work of Kolmogorov in 1941, understanding the statistical properties of fully developed turbulence has remained a major quest. In particular, deriving the properties of turbulent flows from a mesoscopic description, that is from Navier-Stokes equation, has eluded most theoretical attempts. Here, we provide a theoretical prediction for the {\{}$\backslash$it space and time{\}} dependent velocity-velocity correlation function of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence from the field theory associated to Navier-Stokes equation with stochastic forcing. This prediction is the analytical fixed-point solution of Non-Perturbative Renormalisation Group flow equations, which are exact in a certain large wave-number limit. This solution is compared to two-point two-times correlation functions computed in direct numerical simulations. We obtain a remarkable agreement both in the inertial and in the dissipative ranges.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine the invariants p and q of the reduced 2 × 2 velocity gradient tensor (VGT) formed from a two-dimensional (2D) slice of an incompressible three-dimensional (3D) flow. Using data from both 2D particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements and 3D direct numerical simulations of various turbulent flows, we show that the joint probability density functions (p.d.f.s) of p and q exhibit a common characteristic asymmetric shape consistent with {\textless} 0. An explanation for this inequality is proposed. Assuming local homogeneity we derive = 0 and = 0. With the addition of local isotropy the sign of is proved to be the same as that of the skewness of ∂u 1 /∂x 1 , hence negative. This suggests that the observed asymmetry in the joint p.d.f.s of p–q stems from the universal predominance of vortex stretching at the smallest scales. Some advantages of this joint p.d.f. compared with that of Q–R obtained from the full 3 × 3 VGT are discussed. Analysing the eigenvalues of the reduced strain-rate matrix associated with the reduced VGT, we prove that in some cases the 2D data can unambiguously discriminate between the bi-axial (sheet-forming) and axial (tube-forming) strain-rate configurations of the full 3 × 3 strain-rate tensor. 1. Introduction With the arrival of data sets providing access to the full three-dimensional velocity gradient tensor (3D VGT), new ways of analysing this wealth of information have been introduced. The 3D VGT can be written as A ij = ∂u i /∂x j = S ij + W ij , where S ij is the symmetric rate-of-strain tensor and W ij is the antisymmetric rate-of-rotation tensor. One approach is to examine the eigenvalues of S ij . They indicate if the strain-rate tensor is compressing or extending along its principal axes, which in turn determines whether or not the overall strain-rate configuration at a point is sheet forming or tube forming. Another approach is to analyse the local flow topology using the invariants of A ij , as set out by the work of Chong, Perry {\&} Cantwell (1990). In an incompressible flow the number of non-vanishing similarity invariants of the second-order tensor A ij reduces to two, namely Q and R. These two quantities can fully characterize the category to which the local flow topology belongs. The local flow topology refers to the streamline pattern of a region of the flow in the immediate vicinity of the point},

@article{Chapelier2016,
abstract = {This paper aims at understanding the numerical dissipation mechanisms related to the Spectral Difference (SD) method in the context of three-dimensional (3D) turbulence. The numerical dissipation stemming from the discretization of the convective terms is studied by performing inviscid computations of the transitional Taylor–Green vortex and isotropic turbulence configurations. The Taylor–Green vortex computations show that the increase in the order of accuracy restricts the numerical dissipation to smaller scales which, in turn, leads to a better representation of transitional mechanisms. However, isotropic turbulence computations using a fifth-order accuracy or above show obvious manifestations of under-resolution (such as the onset of oscillations and numerical noise), which suggests that the high-order numerical dissipation alone is unable to mimic the dissipation originating from sub-grid scales in the case freely decaying turbulence. Computations of the channel flow configuration at Re$\tau$=1000 at typical large-eddy simulation resolutions show that under-resolved SD discretizations using a high order of accuracy (fifth and sixth) lead to an excellent prediction of the wall-friction, the velocity profiles, the turbulent structures near the wall and the energy spectra, while lower order discretizations lead to an underestimation of the wall-friction and globally a poor representation of wall-bounded turbulence. The present study emphasizes the benefit of using high-order SD discretizations for an accurate representation of turbulent phenomena (namely, transitional and wall-bounded turbulence) but also the necessity of combining this approach with dynamic large-eddy simulation models or appropriate regularization techniques which would activate only where needed to recover physically consistent results, e.g., in regions where fully developed turbulence is present.},

abstract = {A method for the estimation of time-resolved turbulent fields from the combination of non-time-resolved field measurements and time-resolved point measurements is proposed. The approach poses its fundaments on a stochastic estimation based on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of the field measurements and of the time-resolved point measurements. The correlation between the temporal modes of the field measurements and the temporal modes of the point measurements at synchronized instants is evaluated; this correlation is extended to the “out-of-sample” time instants for the field measurements, i.e. those in which field data are not available. In the “out-of-sample” instants, POD modes time coefficients are estimated and the flow fields are reconstructed. The proposed method extends the work by Hosseini et al. (Experiments in fluids, 56, 2015) by proposing a truncation criterion which allows removing the uncorrelated part of the signal from the reconstruction of the flow fields. The truncation is fundamental in case of turbulent flow fields, in which a great wealth of scales is involved, thus reducing the correlation between the probe signal and the field measurements. The threshold selection is based on the random distribution of the uncorrelated signal. Additionally, the selection of the probe time-span to perform the POD analysis on the probe signal is discussed. The method is validated with a synthetic test case and an experimental one. A Direct Numerical Simulation database of a channel flow is selected since its spectral richness is expected to represent a significant challenge for this method. This dataset allows isolating the effects of correlation between field measurements and point measurements, removing issues connected to noise contamination or to the finite spatial resolution which would inevitably affect experimental data. The experimental test case is the wake-flow behind a high-angle-of-attack airfoil with a relatively small number of samples, affected by significant noise. The quality of the dynamic estimation is found to be affected by the noise contamination of the data and by the poor convergence of the POD modes, which add on the effect of the probe location, i.e. on the correlation between probe events and flow features. The squared correlation coefficient between reconstructed data and in-sample data is proposed as an assessment of the flow fields estimation quality. The use of the squared correlation coefficient directly on in-sample data is allowed by the truncation itself.},

abstract = {We derive here Lagrangian fluctuation–dissipation relations for advected scalars in wall-bounded flows. The relations equate the dissipation rate for either passive or active scalars to the variance of scalar inputs from the initial values, boundary values and internal sources, as those are sampled backward in time by stochastic Lagrangian trajectories. New probabilistic concepts are required to represent scalar boundary conditions at the walls: the boundary local-time density at points on the wall where scalar fluxes are imposed and the boundary first hitting time at points where scalar values are imposed. These concepts are illustrated both by analytical results for the problem of pure heat conduction and by numerical results from a database of channel-flow turbulence, which also demonstrate the scalar mixing properties of near-wall turbulence. As an application of the fluctuation–dissipation relation, we examine for wall-bounded flows the relation between anomalous scalar dissipation and Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity, i.e. the persistent non-determinism of Lagrangian particle trajectories in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity. In Part I of this series, we showed that spontaneous stochasticity is the only possible mechanism for anomalous dissipation of passive or active scalars, away from walls. Here it is shown that this remains true when there are no scalar fluxes through walls. Simple examples show, on the other hand, that a distinct mechanism of non-vanishing scalar dissipation can be thin scalar boundary layers near the walls.

abstract = {Motivated by interest in the geometry of high intensity events of turbulent flows, we examine spatial correlation functions of sets where turbulent events are particularly intense. These sets are defined using indicator functions on excursion and iso-value sets. Their geometric scaling properties are analyzed by examining possible power-law decay of their radial correlation function. We apply the analysis to enstrophy, dissipation, and velocity gradient invariants {\$}Q{\$} and {\$}R{\$} and their joint spatial distibutions, using data from a direct numerical simulation of isotropic turbulence at {\$}{\{}\backslashrm Re{\}}{\_}\backslashlambda \backslashapprox 430{\$}. While no fractal scaling is found in the inertial range using box-counting in the finite Reynolds number flow considered here, power-law scaling in the inertial range is found in the radial correlation functions. Thus a geometric characterization in terms of these sets' correlation dimension is possible. Strong dependence on the enstrophy and dissipation threshold is found, consistent with multifractal behavior. Nevertheless the lack of scaling of the box-counting analysis precludes direct quantitative comparisons with earlier work based on the multifractal formalism. Surprising trends, such as a lower correlation dimension for strong dissipation events compared to strong enstrophy events, are observed and interpreted in terms of spatial coherence of vortices in the flow. We show that sets defined by joint conditions on strain and enstrophy, and on {\$}Q{\$} and {\$}R{\$}, also display power law scaling of correlation functions, providing further characterization of the complex spatial structure of these intersection sets.},

However, the underlying assumptions in Kolmogorov's theory appear not to hold with most experimental and numerical data showing evidence of small-scale anisotropy and significant direct energy transfer between the large- and the small-scales. Here, we present a flow structure that reconciles the k−5/3 spectrum with small-scale universality, small-scale anisotropy, and direct scale interactions. The flow structure is a shear layer, which contains the small-scales of motion and is bounded by the large-scales. The anisotropic shear layer reveals the expected scaling of the energy spectrum in nearly all directions.},

abstract = {Magnetic flux conservation in turbulent plasmas at high magnetic Reynolds numbers is argued neither to hold in the conventional sense nor to be entirely broken, but instead to be valid in a statistical sense associated to the "spontaneous stochasticity" of Lagrangian particle trajectories. The latter phenomenon is due to the explosive separation of particles undergoing turbulent Richardson diffusion, which leads to a breakdown of Laplacian determinism for classical dynamics. Empirical evidence is presented for spontaneous stochasticity, including numerical results. A Lagrangian path-integral approach is then exploited to establish stochastic flux freezing for resistive hydromagnetic equations and to argue, based on the properties of Richardson diffusion, that flux conservation must remain stochastic at infinite magnetic Reynolds number. An important application of these results is the kinematic, fluctuation dynamo in nonhelical, incompressible turbulence at magnetic Prandtl number (Pr(m)) equal to unity. Numerical results on the Lagrangian dynamo mechanisms by a stochastic particle method demonstrate a strong similarity between the Pr(m)=1 and 0 dynamos. Stochasticity of field-line motion is an essential ingredient of both. Finally, some consequences for nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, dynamo, and reconnection are briefly considered.},

abstract = {The idea of 'frozen-in' magnetic field lines for ideal plasmas is useful to explain diverse astrophysical phenomena, for example the shedding of excess angular momentum from protostars by twisting of field lines frozen into the interstellar medium. Frozen-in field lines, however, preclude the rapid changes in magnetic topology observed at high conductivities, as in solar flares. Microphysical plasma processes are a proposed explanation of the observed high rates, but it is an open question whether such processes can rapidly reconnect astrophysical flux structures much greater in extent than several thousand ion gyroradii. An alternative explanation is that turbulent Richardson advection brings field lines implosively together from distances far apart to separations of the order of gyroradii. Here we report an analysis of a simulation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence at high conductivity that exhibits Richardson dispersion. This effect of advection in rough velocity fields, which appear non-differentiable in space, leads to line motions that are completely indeterministic or 'spontaneously stochastic', as predicted in analytical studies. The turbulent breakdown of standard flux freezing at scales greater than the ion gyroradius can explain fast reconnection of very large-scale flux structures, both observed (solar flares and coronal mass ejections) and predicted (the inner heliosheath, accretion disks, $\gamma$-ray bursts and so on). For laminar plasma flows with smooth velocity fields or for low turbulence intensity, stochastic flux freezing reduces to the usual frozen-in condition.},

abstract = {The investigation of flows at high Reynolds number is of great interest for the theory of turbulence, in that the large and the small scales of turbulence show a clear separation. But, as the Reynolds number of the flow increases, the size of the Kolmogorov length scale (g) drops almost proportionally. Aiming at achieving the adequate spatial resolution in the central region of a self- similar round jet at high Reynolds numbers (Rek ? 350), a long-range lPIV system was applied. A vector spacing of 1:5g was achieved, where the Kolmogorov length scale was estimated to be 55 lm. The resulting velocity fields were used to characterize the small-scale flow structures in this jet. The autocorrelation maps of vorticity and kci (the imaginary part of the eigenvalue of the reduced velocity gradient tensor) reveal that the structures of intense vor- ticity have a characteristic diameter of approximately 10g. From the autocorrelation map of the reduced (2D) rate of dissipation, it is inferred that the regions of intense dissi- pation tend to organize in the form of sheets with a char- acteristic thickness of approximately 10g. The regions of intense dissipation have the tendency to appear in the vicinity of intense vortices. Furthermore, the joint pdf of the two invariants of the reduced velocity gradient tensor exhibits the characteristic teapot-shape. These results, based on a statistical analysis of the data, are in agreement with previous numerical and experimental studies at lower Reynolds number, which validates the suitability of long- range lPIV for characterizing turbulent flow structures at high Reynolds number.

abstract = {In the large eddy simulation (LES) approach, large-scale energy-containing structures are resolved, smaller structures are filtered out, and unresolved subgrid effects are modeled. Extensive recent work has demonstrated that predictive under-resolved simulations of the velocity fields in turbulent flows are possible without resorting to explicit subgrid models when using a class of physics-capturing high-resolution finite-volume numerical algorithms. This strategy is denoted as implicit LES (ILES). Tests in fundamental applications ranging from canonical to complex flows indicate that ILES is competitive with conventional LES in the LES realm proper-flows driven by large-scale features. The performance of ILES in the substantially more difficult problem of under-resolved material mixing driven by under-resolved velocity fields and initial conditions is a focus of the present work. Progress in addressing relevant resolution issues in studies of mixing driven by Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities in planar shock-tube laboratory experiments is reported. Our particular focus is devoted to the initial material interface characterization and modeling difficulties, and effects of initial condition specifics (resolved spectral content) on transitional and late-time turbulent mixing-which were not previously addressed.

This new approach is significantly different from previous near-wall approaches for LES. In this hybrid TLS-LES approach, a very fine small-scale (SS) mesh is embedded inside the coarse LES mesh. The SS equations capture fine-scale temporal and spatial variations in all three Cartesian directions for all three velocity components near the wall. The TLS-LES equations are derived using a new scale separation operator that allows a smooth transition between the two regions, with the equations in the transition region obtained by blending the TLS large-scale and LES equations. New terms in the hybrid region are identified. The TLS-LES approach is used to study the near-wall features in canonical turbulent channel flows for a range of Reynolds number using relatively coarse large-scale (LS) grids. Results show that the TLS-LES approach is able to capture the effect of both the LS and SS features in the wall region consistently for the range of simulated Reynolds number. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A dynamical systems approach is used to devise a linear estimation tool for channel flow at a friction Reynolds number of {\$}Re{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D70F{\}}{\}}=1000{\$} . The estimator uses time-resolved velocity measurements at a single wall-normal location to estimate the velocity field at other wall-normal locations (the data coming from direct numerical simulations). The estimation tool builds on the work of McKeon {\&} Sharma ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 658, 2010, pp. 336–382) by using a Navier–Stokes-based linear model and treating any nonlinear terms as unknown forcings to an otherwise linear system. In this way nonlinearities are not ignored, but instead treated as an unknown model input. It is shown that, while the linear estimator qualitatively reproduces large-scale flow features, it tends to overpredict the amplitude of velocity fluctuations – particularly for structures that are long in the streamwise direction and thin in the spanwise direction. An alternative linear model is therefore formed in which a simple eddy viscosity is used to model the influence of the small-scale turbulent fluctuations on the large scales of interest. This modification improves the estimator performance significantly. Importantly, as well as improving the performance of the estimator, the linear model with eddy viscosity is also able to predict with reasonable accuracy the range of wavenumber pairs and the range of wall-normal heights over which the estimator will perform well.},

abstract = {The statistics of the velocity gradient tensor in turbulent flows are of both theoretical and practical importance. The Lagrangian view provides a privileged perspective for studying the dynamics of turbulence in general, and of the velocity gradient tensor in particular. Stochastic models for the Lagrangian evolution of velocity gradients in isotropic turbulence, with closure models for the pressure Hesssian and viscous Laplacian, have been shown to reproduce important features such as non-Gaussian probability distributions, skewness and vorticity strain-rate alignments. The Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD) closure introduced the idea of mapping an isotropic Lagrangian pressure Hessian as upstream initial condition using the fluid deformation tensor. Recent work on a Gaussian fields closure, however, has shown that even Gaussian isotropic velocity fields contain significant anisotropy for the conditional pressure Hessian tensor due to the inherent velocity-pressure couplings, and that assuming an isotropic pressure Hessian as upstream condition may not be realistic. In this paper, Gaussian isotropic field statistics are used to generate more physical upstream conditions for the recent fluid deformation mapping. In this new framework, known isotropy relations can be satisfied {\{}$\backslash$it a priori{\}} and no DNS-tuned coefficients are necessary. A detailed comparison of results from the new model, referred to as the recent deformation of Gaussian fields (RDGF) closure, with existing models and DNS shows the improvements gained, especially in various single-time statistics of the velocity gradient tensor at moderate Reynolds numbers. Application to arbitrarily high Reynolds numbers remains an open challenge for this type of model, however.},

In this paper, we introduce a method for coupling existing stochastic models for the Lagrangian evolution of the velocity gradient tensor with coarse-grained fluid simulations to recover small-scale physics without resorting to direct numerical simulations (DNS). The proposed approach is implemented in LES of turbulent channel flow and detailed comparisons with DNS are carried out. An application to modelling the fate of deformable, small (sub-Kolmogorov) droplets at negligible Stokes number and low volume fraction with one-way coupling is carried out and results are again compared to DNS results. Results illustrate the ability of the proposed model to predict the influence of small-scale turbulence on droplet micro-physics in the context of LES.},

Even for opaque lines we demonstrate superior rendering performance compared to GPU rasterization of lines, and when transparency is used we can interactively render large amounts of lines that are infeasible to be rendered via rasterization. To achieve this, we propose a direction-preserving encoding of lines into a regular voxel grid, along with the quantization of directions using face-to-face connectivity in this grid. On the regular grid structure, parallel GPU ray-casting is used to determine visible fragments in correct visibility order. To enable interactive rendering of global illumination effects like low-frequency shadows and ambient occlusions, illumination simulation is performed during ray-casting on a level-of-detail (LoD) line representation that considers the number of lines and their lengths per voxel. In this way we can render effects which are very difficult to render via GPU rasterization. A detailed performance and quality evaluation compares our approach to rasterization-based rendering of lines.},

abstract = {The specification of inlet conditions for eddy-resolving simulations is an important research question in turbulence research. A large number of schemes have been proposed but comparisons to a benchmark simulation are usually undertaken in such a way that it is ambiguous as to whether the source of the improved preservation of the properties of the benchmark case is due to the physics captured in the inlet generation algorithm or to differences in the precise values or spectra generated at a particular position. This article uses gradual wavelet reconstruction to degrade a precursor simulation such that the time series input at each cell has the same histogram and Fourier spectrum as the original precursor case, thereby removing this source of variability. A parameter, $\rho$, is used to index the nature of the degraded inlets and as $\rho$ increases from 0 to 1 the cross-correlative and nonlinear properties of the precursor are increasingly preserved too. We compare the results of four large-eddy simulations for the flow over a wall-mounted square rib and show that there are clear differences between these simulations for the flow before and over the rib, and in the far-field. However, in the wake, the intense shearing and mixing means that any differences are harder to attribute to the nature of the inlet. Hence, for flows that are mixed strongly, there is less of a need to preserve the cross-correlative structure of the inlet condition as long as the individual velocity components are modelled with an appropriate set of values and Fourier spectrum. By comparing particular inlet generation algorithms in terms of the value for $\rho$ that they can attain, their suitability for modelling flows of particular configurations may be determined.},

abstract = {The velocity gradient tensor for turbulent flow contains crucial information on the topology of turbulence, vortex stretching and the dissipation of energy. A Schur decomposition of the velocity gradient tensor (VGT) is introduced to supplement the standard decomposition into rotation and strain tensors. Thus, the normal parts of the tensor (represented by the eigenvalues) are separated explicitly from non-normality. Using a direct numerical simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence, it is shown that the norm of the non-normal part of the tensor is of a similar magnitude to the normal part. It is common to examine the second and third invariants of the characteristic equation of the tensor simultaneously (the {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D64C{\}}{\{}-{\}}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D64D{\}}{\$} diagram). With the Schur approach, the discriminant function separating real and complex eigenvalues of the VGT has an explicit form in terms of strain and enstrophy: where eigenvalues are all real, enstrophy arises from the non-normal term only. Re-deriving the evolution equations for enstrophy and total strain highlights the production of non-normality and interaction production (normal straining of non-normality). These cancel when considering the evolution of the VGT in terms of its eigenvalues but are important for the full dynamics. Their properties as a function of location in {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D64C{\}}{\{}-{\}}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D64D{\}}{\$} space are characterized. The Schur framework is then used to explain two properties of the VGT: the preference to form disc-like rather than rod-like flow structures, and the vorticity vector and strain alignments. In both cases, non-normality is critical for explaining behaviour in vortical regions.},

abstract = {3D Particle Imaging Velocimetry (3D-PIV) aim to recover the flow field in a volume of fluid, which has been seeded with tracer particles and observed from multiple camera viewpoints. The first step of 3D-PIV is to reconstruct the 3D locations of the tracer particles from synchronous views of the volume. We propose a new method for iterative particle reconstruction (IPR), in which the locations and intensities of all particles are inferred in one joint energy minimization. The energy function is designed to penalize deviations between the reconstructed 3D particles and the image evidence, while at the same time aiming for a sparse set of particles. We find that the new method, without any post-processing, achieves significantly cleaner particle volumes than a conventional, tomographic MART reconstruction, and can handle a wide range of particle densities. The second step of 3D-PIV is to then recover the dense motion field from two consecutive particle reconstructions. We propose a variational model, which makes it possible to directly include physical properties, such as incompressibility and viscosity, in the estimation of the motion field. To further exploit the sparse nature of the input data, we propose a novel, compact descriptor of the local particle layout. Hence, we avoid the memory-intensive storage of high-resolution intensity volumes. Our framework is generic and allows for a variety of different data costs (correlation measures) and regularizers. We quantitatively evaluate it with both the sum of squared differences (SSD) and the normalized cross-correlation (NCC), respectively with both a hard and a soft version of the incompressibility constraint.},

abstract = {The standard approach to densely reconstruct the motion in a volume of fluid is to inject high-contrast tracer particles and record their motion with multiple high-speed cameras. Almost all existing work processes the acquired multi-view video in two separate steps: first, a per-frame reconstruction of the particles, usually in the form of soft occupancy likelihoods in a voxel representation; followed by 3D motion estimation, with some form of dense matching between the precomputed voxel grids from different time steps. In this sequential procedure, the first step cannot use temporal consistency considerations to support the reconstruction, while the second step has no access to the original, high-resolution image data. We show, for the first time, how to jointly reconstruct both the individual tracer particles and a dense 3D fluid motion field from the image data, using an integrated energy minimization. Our hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian model explicitly reconstructs individual particles, and at the same time recovers a dense 3D motion field in the entire domain. Making particles explicit greatly reduces the memory consumption and allows one to use the high-resolution input images for matching. Whereas the dense motion field makes it possible to include physical a-priori constraints and account for the incompressibility and viscosity of the fluid. The method exhibits greatly ({\~{}}70{\%}) improved results over a recent baseline with two separate steps for 3D reconstruction and motion estimation. Our results with only two time steps are comparable to those of state-of-the-art tracking-based methods that require much longer sequences.},

Fluid dynamics re-searchers have developed variants of space-carving to re-construct the 3D particle distribution at a given time-step, and then use relatively simple local matching to recover the motion over time. On the contrary, estimating the opti-cal flow between two consecutive images is a long-standing standard problem in computer vision, but only little work exists about volumetric 3D flow. Here, we propose a varia-tional method for 3D fluid flow estimation from multi-view data. We start from a 3D version of the standard varia-tional flow model, and investigate different regularization schemes that ensure divergence-free flow fields, to account for the physics of incompressible fluids. Moreover, we pro-pose a semi-dense formulation, to cope with the computa-tional demands of large volumetric datasets. Flow is esti-mated and regularized at a lower spatial resolution, while the data term is evaluated at full resolution to preserve the discriminative power and geometric precision of the local particle distribution. Extensive experiments reveal that a simple sum of squared differences (SSD) is the most suit-able data term for our application. For regularization, an energy whose Euler-Lagrange equations correspond to the stationary Stokes equations leads to the best results. This strictly enforces a divergence-free flow and additionally pe-nalizes the squared gradient of the flow.},

Whilst velocity gradient statistics and dynamics have been well characterised, the connection between structure and dynamics has largely focused on rotation-dominated flow and relied upon data from numerical simulation alone. Using numerical and spatially resolved experimental datasets of homogeneous turbulence, the role of structure is examined for all local (incompressible) flow topologies characterisable by {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D63C{\}}{\$} . Structures are studied through the footprints they leave in conditional averages of the {\$}Q=-\backslashtext{\{}Tr{\}}(\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D63C{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}})/2{\$} field, pertinent to non-local strain production, obtained using two complementary conditional averaging techniques. The first, stochastic estimation, approximates the {\$}Q{\$} field conditioned upon {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D63C{\}}{\$} and educes quantitatively similar structure in both datasets, dissimilar to that of random Gaussian velocity fields. Moreover, it strongly resembles a promising model for velocity gradient dynamics recently proposed by Wilczek {\&} Meneveau ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 756, 2014, pp. 191–225), but is derived under a less restrictive premise, with explicitly determined closure coefficients. The second technique examines true conditional averages of the {\$}Q{\$} field, which is used to validate the stochastic estimation and provide insights towards the model's refinement. Jointly, these approaches confirm that vortex tubes are the predominant feature of rotation-dominated regions and additionally show that shear layer structures are active in strain-dominated regions. In both cases, kinematic features of these structures explain alignment statistics of the pressure Hessian eigenvectors and why local and non-local strain production act in opposition to each other.},

The second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables, combined with the assumption of isotropy for the conditionally averaged Lagrangian velocity gradient tensor and with the recent fluid deformation approximation. It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basic closure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the matrix exponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by its transpose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown to provide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow a reinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures. The basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated by implementing it successfully in large eddy simulation of forced isotropic turbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation of entirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other nonlinear scrambling terms. But unlike eddy-viscosity closures, the matrix exponential approach provides a simple and local closure that can be derived directly from the stress transport equation with the production term, and using physically motivated assumptions about Lagrangian decorrelation and upstream isotropy.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s). The experimental evaluation of the topological characteristics of the turbulent flow in a ‘box' of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (HIT) with zero mean velocity is presented. This requires an initial evaluation of the effect of signal noise on measurement of velocity invariants. The joint probability distribution functions (pdfs) of experimentally evaluated, noise contaminated, velocity invariants have a different shape than the corresponding noise-free joint pdfs obtained from the DNS data of the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) open resource HIT database. A noise model, based on Gaussian and impulsive Salt and Pepper noise, is established and added artificially to the DNS velocity vector field of the JHU database. Digital filtering methods, based on Median and Wiener Filters, are chosen to eliminate the modeled noise source and their capacity to restore the joint pdfs of velocity invariants to that of the noise-free DNS data is examined. The remaining errors after filtering are quantified by evaluating the global mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and global turbulent homogeneity, assessed through the behavior of the ratio of the standard deviation of the velocity fluctuations in two directions, the energy spectrum of the velocity fluctuations and the eigenvalues of the rate-of-strain tensor. A method of data filtering, based on median filtered velocity using different median filter window size, is used to quantify the clustering of zero velocity points of the turbulent field using the radial distribution function (RDF) and Vorono{\"{i}} analysis to analyze the 2D time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV) velocity measurements. It was found that a median filter with window size 3 × 3 vector spacing is the effective and efficient approach to eliminate the experimental noise from PIV measured velocity images to a satisfactory level and extract the statistical two-dimensional topological turbulent flow patterns.},

@article{Liu2013,
abstract = {The flow structure and turbulence in an open cavity shear layer has been investigated experimentally at a Reynolds number of 4.0 × 104, with an emphasis on interactions of the unsteady pressure field with the cavity corners. A large database of time-resolved two-dimensional PIV measurements has been used to obtain the velocity distributions and calculate the pressure by spatially integrating the material acceleration at a series of sample areas covering the entire shear layer and the flow surrounding the corners. Conditional sampling, low-pass filtering and time correlations among variables enable us to elucidate several processes, which have distinctly different frequency ranges, that dominate the shear layer interactions with the corners. Kelvin-Helmholtz shear layer eddies have the expected Strouhal number range of 0.5-3.2. Their interactions with the trailing corner introduce two sources of vorticity fluctuations above the corner. The first is caused by the expected advection of remnants of the shear layer eddies. The second source involves fluctuations in local viscous vorticity flux away from the wall caused by periodic variations in the streamwise pressure gradients. This local production peaks when the shear layer vortices are located away from the corner, creating a lingering region with peak vorticity just above the corner. The associated periodic pressure minima there are lower than any other point in the entire flow field, making the region above the corner most prone to cavitation inception. Flapping of the shear layer and boundary layer upstream of the leading corner occurs at very low Strouhal numbers of {\~{}}0.05, affecting all the flow and turbulence quantities around both corners. Time-dependent correlations of the shear layer elevation show that the flapping starts in the boundary layer upstream of the leading corner and propagates downstream at the free stream speed. Near the trailing corner, when the shear layer elevation is low, the stagnation pressure in front of the wall, the downward jetting flow along this wall, the fraction of shear layer vorticity entrained back into the cavity, and the magnitude of the pressure minimum above the corner are higher than those measured when the shear layer is high. However, the variations in downward jetting decay rapidly with increasing distance from the trailing corner, indicating that it does not play a direct role in a feedback mechanism that sustains the flapping. There is also low correlation between the boundary/shear layer elevation and the returning flow along the upstream vertical wall, providing little evidence that this returning flow affects the flapping directly. However, the characteristic period of flapping, {\~{}}0.6 s, is consistent with recirculation time of the fluid within the cavity away from boundaries. The high negative correlations of shear/boundary layer elevation with the streamwise pressure gradient above the leading corner introduce a plausible mechanism that sustains the flapping: when the shear layer is low, the boundary layer is subjected to high adverse streamwise pressure gradients that force it to widen, and when the shear layer is high, the pressure gradients decrease, allowing the boundary layer to thin down. Flow mechanisms that would cause the flapping-induced pressure changes, and their relations to the flow within the cavity are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {The invariants of the velocity gradient tensor, {\$}R{\$} and {\$}Q{\$}, and their enstrophy and strain components are studied in the logarithmic layer of an incompressible turbulent channel flow. The velocities are filtered in the three spatial directions and the results analyzed at different scales. We show that the {\$}R{\$}--{\$}Q{\$} plane does not capture the changes undergone by the flow as the filter width increases, and that the enstrophy/enstrophy-production and strain/strain-production planes represent better choices. We also show that the conditional mean trajectories may differ significantly from the instantaneous behavior of the flow since they are the result of an averaging process where the mean is 3-5 times smaller than the corresponding standard deviation. The orbital periods in the {\$}R{\$}--{\$}Q{\$} plane are shown to be independent of the intensity of the events, and of the same order of magnitude than those in the enstrophy/enstrophy-production and strain/strain-production planes. Our final goal is to test whether the dynamics of the flow are self-similar in the inertial range, and the answer turns out to be no. The mean shear is found to be responsible for the absence of self-similarity and progressively controls the dynamics of the eddies observed as the filter width increases. However, a self-similar behavior emerges when the calculations are repeated for the fluctuating velocity gradient tensor. Finally, the turbulent cascade in terms of vortex stretching is considered by computing the alignment of the vorticity at a given scale with the strain at a different one. These results generally support a non-negligible role of the phenomenological energy-cascade model formulated in terms of vortex stretching.},

Further, we find that the restricted Euler (RE) dynamics are primarily counteracted by the deviatoric non-local part of the pressure Hessian and not by the viscous term.

After describing the theoretical framework, the method is tested on synthetic and experimental images, and compared with well-known pre-processing techniques in terms of image quality enhancement, improvements in the PIV interrogation and computational cost. The results show that, unlike existing techniques, the proposed method is robust in the presence of significant background noise intensity, gradients, and temporal oscillations. Moreover, the computational cost is one to two orders of magnitude lower than conventional image normalization methods.

abstract = {The expected universality of small-scale properties of turbulent flows implies isotropic properties of the velocity gradient tensor in the very large Reynolds number limit. Using direct numerical simulations, we determine the tensors formed by n = 2 and 3 velocity gradients at a single point in turbulent homogeneous shear flows, and in the log-layer of a turbulent channel flow, and we characterize the departure of these tensors from the corresponding isotropic prediction. Specifically, we separate the even components of the tensors, invariant under reflexion with respect to all axes, from the odd ones, which identically vanish in the absence of shear. Our results indicate that the largest deviation from isotropy comes from the odd component of the third velocity gradient correlation function, especially from the third moment of the derivative along the normal direction of the streamwise velocity component. At the Reynolds numbers considered (R{\_}lambda {\~{}} 140), we observe that these second and third order correlation functions are significantly larger in turbulent channel flows than in homogeneous shear flow. Overall, our work demonstrates that a mean shear leads to relatively simple structure of the velocity gradient tensor. How isotropy is restored in the very large Reynolds limit remains to be understood.},

Away from the wall, in the logarithmic layer, the skewness of the normal derivative of the streamwise velocity fluctuation is approximately constant, of order 1, while the Reynolds number based on the Taylor scale is {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D706{\}}{\}}\backslashapprox 150{\$} . This defines a small-scale anisotropy that is stronger than in turbulent homogeneous shear flows at comparable values of {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D706{\}}{\}}{\$} . In contrast, the vorticity–strain correlations that characterize homogeneous isotropic turbulence are nearly unchanged in channel flow even though they do vary with distance from the wall with an exponent that can be inferred from the local dissipation. Our results demonstrate that the statistical properties of the fluctuating velocity gradient in turbulent channel flow are characterized, on one hand, by observables that are insensitive to the anisotropy, and behave as in homogeneous isotropic flows, and on the other hand by quantities that are much more sensitive to the anisotropy. How this seemingly contradictory situation emerges from the simultaneous action of the flux of energy to small scales and the transport of momentum away from the wall remains to be elucidated.},

Sensitivity and ability of this modelling approach to predict fundamental features (such as backscatter, counter-gradient turbulent transport, small-scale vorticity, etc.) seen in high Re turbulent flows is assessed here by using two direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets corresponding to a forced isotropic turbulence at Taylor's microscale-based Reynolds number Re $\lambda$ ≈ 433 and a fully developed turbulent flow in a periodic channel at friction Reynolds number Re $\tau$ ≈ 1000. It is shown that TLS captures the dynamics of local co-/counter-gradient transport and backscatter at the requisite scales of interest. These observations are further confirmed through a posteriori investigation of the flow in a periodic channel at Re $\tau$ = 2000. The results reveal that the TLS method can capture both the large- and the small-scale flow physics in a consistent manner, and at a reduced overall cost when compared to the estimated DNS or wall-resolved LES cost.},

The framework accounts for noise in the independent variables, and we present alternative formulations for accounting for discrepancies between model and data. To generate probability densities for flow characteristics, posterior densities for sub-grid scale model parameters are propagated forward through LES of channel flow and compared with DNS data. Synthesis of the calibration and prediction results demonstrates that model parameters have an explicit filter width dependence and are highly correlated. Dis- crepancies between DNS and calibrated LES results point to additional model form inadequacies that need to be accounted for.},

abstract = {Numerical and experimental turbulence simulations are nowadays reaching the size of the so-called big data, thus requiring refined investigative tools for appropriate statistical analyses and data mining. We present a new approach based on the complex network theory, offering a powerful framework to explore complex systems with a huge number of interacting elements. Although interest on complex networks has been increasing in the last years, few recent studies have been applied to turbulence. We propose an investigation starting from a two-point correlation for the kinetic energy of a forced isotropic field numerically solved. Among all the metrics analyzed, the degree centrality is the most significant, suggesting the formation of spatial patterns which coherently move with similar vorticity over the large eddy turnover time scale. Pattern size can be quantified through a newly-introduced parameter (i.e., average physical distance) and varies from small to intermediate scales. The network analysis allows a systematic identification of different spatial regions, providing new insights into the spatial characterization of turbulent flows. Based on present findings, the application to highly inhomogeneous flows seems promising and deserves additional future investigation.},

abstract = {Turbophoresis leading to preferential concentration of inertial particles in regions of low turbulent diffusivity is a unique feature of inhomogeneous turbulent flows, such as free shear flows or wall-bounded flows. In this work, the theory for clustering of weakly inertial particles in homogeneous turbulence is extended to the inhomogeneous case of a turbulent channel flow. The inhomogeneity contributes to the cluster formation in addition to clustering in homogeneous turbulence. A space-dependent rate for the creation of inhomogeneous particle concentration is derived in terms of local statistics of turbulence. We provide the formula for the pair-correlation function of concentration that factorizes in product of time and space-dependent average concentrations and time-independent factor of clustering that obeys a power-law in the distance between the points. This power-law characterizes inhomogeneous multifractality of the particle distribution. A unique demonstration and quantification of the combined effects of turbophoresis and fractal clustering in a direct numerical simulation of particle motion in a turbulent channel flow is performed according to the presented theory. The strongest contribution to clustering coming from the inhomogeneity of the flow occurs in the transitional region between viscous sublayer and the buffer layer. Further the ratio of homogeneous and inhomogeneous term depends on the wall distance. The inhomogeneous terms may significantly increase the preferential concentration of inertial particles, thus the overall degree of clustering in inhomogeneous turbulence is potentially stronger compared to particles with the same inertia in purely homogeneous turbulence.},

abstract = {Despite the ongoing efforts in turbulence research, the universal properties of the turbulence small-scale structure and the relationships between small-and large-scale turbulent motions are not yet fully understood. The visually guided exploration of turbulence features, including the interactive selection and simultaneous visualization of multiple features, can further progress our understanding of turbulence. Accomplishing this task for flow fields in which the full turbulence spectrum is well resolved is challenging on desktop computers. This is due to the extreme resolution of such fields, requiring memory and bandwidth capacities going beyond what is currently available. To overcome these limitations, we present a GPU system for feature-based turbulence visualization that works on a compressed flow field representation. We use a wavelet-based compression scheme including run-length and entropy encoding, which can be decoded on the GPU and embedded into brick-based volume ray-casting. This enables a drastic reduction of the data to be streamed from disk to GPU memory. Our system derives turbulence properties directly from the velocity gradient tensor, and it either renders these properties in turn or generates and renders scalar feature volumes. The quality and efficiency of the system is demonstrated in the visualization of two unsteady turbulence simulations, each comprising a spatio-temporal resolution of 10244. On a desktop computer, the system can visualize each time step in 5 seconds, and it achieves about three times this rate for the visualization of a scalar feature volume. {\textcopyright} 1995-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Tunstall2017,
abstract = {This paper presents a combined RANS and LES methodology, which automates the dual-mesh hybrid LES/RANS approach and circumvents the need for wall-functions. Unlike RANS, wall-resolved LES is still unaffordable for studying high Reynolds number complex flows in industry and requires much user expertise when turbulence features are unknown a priori. The present approach avoids these issues by concurrently solving the LES and unsteady RANS equations on separate meshes, which are adapted to each model and are overlapping over the entire domain. The RANS solution guides the LES where its mesh is too coarse, and vice-versa where the LES is well-resolved. The driver- and driven-simulation locally swap roles automatically, depending on which one is deemed more reliable by a blending function. Consistency between the RANS solution and a temporal average of the LES solution is enforced by drift terms, whose strength depend on relaxation times-scales that are provided by the RANS model. Predictions for fully-developed channel flows and the flow through periodic hills are shown to be in excellent agreement with reference data. The LES grids are deliberately too coarse for wall-resolved LES, while the independent RANS mesh uses high aspect-ratio cells to economically resolve the near-wall layer.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s) We present a proof-of-concept for the adaptive mesh refinement method applied to atmospheric boundary-layer simulations. Such a method may form an attractive alternative to static grids for studies on atmospheric flows that have a high degree of scale separation in space and/or time. Examples include the diurnal cycle and a convective boundary layer capped by a strong inversion. For such cases, large-eddy simulations using regular grids often have to rely on a subgrid-scale closure for the most challenging regions in the spatial and/or temporal domain. Here we analyze a flow configuration that describes the growth and subsequent decay of a convective boundary layer using direct numerical simulation (DNS). We validate the obtained results and benchmark the performance of the adaptive solver against two runs using fixed regular grids. It appears that the adaptive-mesh algorithm is able to coarsen and refine the grid dynamically whilst maintaining an accurate solution. In particular, during the initial growth of the convective boundary layer a high resolution is required compared to the subsequent stage of decaying turbulence. More specifically, the number of grid cells varies by two orders of magnitude over the course of the simulation. For this specific DNS case, the adaptive solver was not yet more efficient than the more traditional solver that is dedicated to these types of flows. However, the overall analysis shows that the method has a clear potential for numerical investigations of the most challenging atmospheric cases.},

abstract = {Forcing the experimental volumetric velocity fields to satisfy mass conversation principles has been proved beneficial for improving the quality of measured data. A number of correction methods including the divergence correction scheme (DCS) have been proposed to remove divergence errors from measurement velocity fields. For tomographic particle image velocimetry (TPIV) data, the measurement uncertainty for the velocity component along the light thickness direction is typically much larger than for the other two components. Such biased measurement errors would weaken the performance of traditional correction methods. The paper proposes a variant for the existing DCS by adding weighting coefficients to the three velocity components, named as the weighting DCS (WDCS). The generalized cross validation (GCV) method is employed to choose the suitable weighting coefficients. A fast algorithm for DCS or WDCS is developed, making the correction process significantly low-cost to implement. WDCS has strong advantages when correcting velocity components with biased noise levels. Numerical tests validate the accuracy and efficiency of the fast algorithm, the effectiveness of GCV method, and the advantages of WDCS. Lastly, DCS and WDCS are employed to process experimental velocity fields from the TPIV measurement of a turbulent boundary layer. This shows that WDCS achieves a better performance than DCS in improving some flow statistics.},

abstract = {Quantifying the turbulent dissipation rate provides insight into the physics of the turbulent flows. However, the accuracy of estimating turbulent dissipation rate using velocity data measured by planar PIV is affected by the way of modeling the unresolved velocity gradient terms and the PIV spatial resolution. In this paper, we first give a brief review of different methods used to estimate turbulent dissipation rate. Then synthetic PIV data are generated from a turbulence DNS dataset for validating the effectiveness of different methods. Direct estimate of turbulent dissipation rate from its definition using velocity gradients, with the assumption of isotropy, local axisymmetry, or local isotropy, shows significant decrease as interrogation window size increases. On the other hand, the indirect estimation of turbulent dissipation rate from energy spectra and structure function demonstrate less severe decrease as interrogation window size increases. We further propose two modified methods. The Modified Structure Function Method relies on an empirical relationship established by analyzing the synthetic PIV data. For a given measured value turbulent dissipation rate under a given interrogation window size, the true value can be determined from this relationship. The Modified Spectra Curvefit Method accounts the averaging effect introduced by the interrogation window in PIV processing algorithm and thus gives a better calculation of the energy spectra. When the new spectra data are used to curve fit the -5/3 slope, an improved estimate of turbulent dissipation rate is expected. Both modified methods are applied to experimental PIV data acquired from a turbulent jet experiment. They give nearly converged estimates of turbulent dissipation rate and Kolmogorov scale at different interrogation window sizes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The statistical properties of turbulence differ in an essential way from those of systems in or near thermal equilibrium because of the flux of energy between vastly different scales at which energy is supplied and at which it is dissipated. We elucidate this difference by studying experimentally and numerically the fluctuations of the energy of a small fluid particle moving in a turbulent fluid. We demonstrate how the fundamental property of detailed balance is broken, so that the probabilities of forward and backward transitions are not equal for turbulence. In physical terms, we found that in a large set of flow configurations, fluid elements decelerate faster than accelerate, a feature known all too well from driving in dense traffic. The statistical signature of rare "flight-crash" events, associated with fast particle deceleration, provides a way to quantify irreversibility in a turbulent flow. Namely, we find that the third moment of the power fluctuations along a trajectory, nondimensionalized by the energy flux, displays a remarkable power law as a function of the Reynolds number, both in two and in three spatial dimensions. This establishes a relation between the irreversibility of the system and the range of active scales. We speculate that the breakdown of the detailed balance characterized here is a general feature of other systems very far from equilibrium, displaying a wide range of spatial scales.},

The Lagrangian analysis uses data in a public database generated using direct numerical simulation of the Naiver-Stokes equations, at a Reynolds number 430. It is confirmed that when averaging over the entire domain, correlation functions decay on timescales on the order of the mean Kolmogorov turnover time scale, computed from the globally averaged rate of dissipation and viscosity. However, when performing the analysis in different subregions of the flow, turbulence intermittency leads to large spatial variability in the decay time scales. Remarkably, excellent collapse of the auto-correlation functions is recovered when using the `local Kolmogorov time-scale' defined using the locally averaged, rather than the global, dissipation-rate. This provides new evidence for the validity of Kolmogorov's Refined Similarity Hypothesis, but from a Lagrangian viewpoint that provides a natural frame to describe the dynamical time evolution of turbulence.},

abstract = {We study Lagrangian statistics of the magnitudes of velocity and pressure gradients in isotropic turbulence by quantifying their correlation functions and their characteristic time scales. In a recent work (Yu and Meneveau, Phys Rev Lett 104:084502, 2010), it has been found that the Lagrangian time-correlations of the velocity and pressure gradient tensor and vector elements scale with the locally- definedKolmogorov time scale, evaluated from the locally-averaged dissipation-rate (?r) and viscosity ($\nu$) according to $\tau$K,r = √$\nu$/?r. In thiswork, we study theLagrangian time-correlations of the absolute values of velocity and pressure gradients. It has long been known that such correlations display longer memories into the inertial- range as well as possible intermittency effects. We explore the appropriate temporal scales with the aim to achieve collapse of the correlation functions. The data used in this study are sampled from the web-services accessible public turbulence database (http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu). The database archives a 10244 (space+time) pseudo- spectral direct numerical simulation of forced isotropic turbulence with Taylor- scale Reynolds number Re$\lambda$ = 433, and supports spatial differentiation and spa- tial/temporal interpolation inside the database. The analysis shows that the temporal auto-correlations of the absolute values extend deep into the inertial range where they are determined not by the local Kolmogorov time-scale but by the local eddy-turnover time scale defined as $\tau$e,r = r2/3?−1/3 r .However, considerable scatter remains and appears to be reduced only after a further (intermittency) correction factor of the form of (r/L)$\chi$ is introduced, where L is the turbulence integral scale. The exponent $\chi$ varies for different variables. The collapse of the correlation functions for absolute values is, however, less satisfactory than the collapse observed for the more rapidly decaying strain-rate tensor element correlation functions in the viscous range.},

abstract = {Interaction of a compliant wall with a turbulent channel flow is investigated experimentally by simultaneously measuring the time-resolved, three-dimensional (3D) flow field and the two-dimensional (2D) surface deformation. The optical set-up integrates tomographic particle image velocimetry to measure the flow with Mach–Zehnder interferometry to map the deformation. The Reynolds number is {\$}Re{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D70F{\}}{\}}=2300{\$} , and the Young's modulus of the wall is 0.93 MPa, resulting in a ratio of shear speed to the centreline velocity ( {\$}U{\_}{\{}0{\}}{\$} ) of 6.8. The wavenumber–frequency spectra of deformation show the surface motions consist of a non-advected low-frequency component and advected modes, some travelling downstream at approximately {\$}U{\_}{\{}0{\}}{\$} and others at {\$}{\{}\backslashsim{\}}0.72U{\_}{\{}0{\}}{\$} . The r.m.s. values of the advected and non-advected modes are {\$}0.04{\~{}}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x03BC{\}}\backslashtext{\{}m{\}}{\$} {\$}(0.004\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D6FF{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D708{\}}{\}}){\$} and {\$}0.2{\~{}}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x03BC{\}}\backslashtext{\{}m{\}}{\$} ( {\$}0.02\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D6FF{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D708{\}}{\}}{\$} ), respectively, much smaller than the wall unit ( {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D6FF{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D708{\}}{\}}{\$} ), hence they do not affect the flow. Trends in the wall dynamics are elucidated by correlating the deformation with flow variables, including the 3D pressure distribution calculated by spatially integrating the material acceleration. Predictions by the Chase [ J. Acoust. Soc. Am. , vol. 89 (6), pp. 2589–2596] linear model are also calculated and compared to the measured trends. The spatial deformation–pressure correlations peak at {\$}y/h\backslashapprox 0.12{\$} ( {\$}h{\$} is half channel height), the elevation of Reynolds shear stress maximum in the log-layer. Streamwise lagging of the deformation behind the pressure is caused in part by phase lag of the pressure with decreasing distance from the wall, and in part by material damping. Positive deformations (bumps) caused by negative pressure fluctuations are preferentially associated with ejections involving spanwise vortices located downstream and quasi-streamwise vortices with spanwise offset. Results of conditional correlations are consistent with the presence of hairpin-like structures. The negative deformations (dimples) are preferentially associated with positive pressure fluctuations at the transition between an upstream sweep to a downstream ejection.},
