abstract = {A recently developed public turbulence database system (http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu) provides new ways to access large datasets generated from high-performance com-puter simulations of turbulent flows to perform numerical experiments. The database archives 1024 4 (spatial and time) data points obtained from a pseudo-spectral direct numerical simulation (DNS) of forced isotropic turbulence. The flow's Taylor-scale Reynolds number is Re $\lambda$ = 443, and the simulation output spans about one large-scale eddy turnover time. Besides the stored velocity and pressure fields, built-in first-and second-order space differentiation, as well as spatial and temporal interpolations are implemented on the database. The resulting 27 terabytes of data are public and can be accessed remotely through an interface based on a modern Web-services model. Users may write and execute analysis programs on their host computers, while the programs make subroutine-like calls (getFunctions) requesting desired variables (velocity and pressure, and their gradients) over the network. The architecture of the database and the initial built-in functionalities are described in a previous paper of Journal of Tur- A public turbulence database cluster and applications to study Lagrangian evolution of velocity increments in turbulence, J. Turbul. 9 (2008), p. N31). In the present paper, further developments of the database system are described; mainly the newly developed getPosition function. Given an initial position, integration time-step, as well as an initial and end time, the getPosition function tracks arrays of fluid particles and returns particle locations at the end of the trajectory integration time. The getPosition function is tested by comparing with trajectories computed outside of the database. It is then applied to study the Lagrangian velocity structure functions as well as the tensor-based Lagrangian time correlation functions. The roles of pressure Hessian and viscous terms in the evolution of the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor are explored by comparing the time correlations with and without these terms. Besides the getPosition function, several other updates to the database are described such as a function to access the forcing term in the DNS, a new more efficient interpolation algorithm based on partial sums, and a new Matlab interface.},

abstract = {abstractThe output from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent channel flow at Re$\tau$ ≈ 1000 is used to construct a publicly and Web services accessible, spatio-temporal database for this flow. The simulated channel has a size of 8$\pi$h × 2h × 3$\pi$h, where h is the channel half-height. Data are stored at 2048 × 512 × 1536 spatial grid points for a total of 4000 time samples every 5 time steps of the DNS. These cover an entire channel flow-through time, i.e. the time it takes to traverse the entire channel length 8$\pi$h at the mean velocity of the bulk flow. Users can access the database through an interface that is based on the Web services model and perform numerical experiments on the slightly over 100 terabytes (TB) DNS data on their remote platforms, such as laptops or local desktops. Additional technical details about the pressure calculation, database interpolation, and differentiation tools are provided in several appendices. As a sample application of the channel flow database, we use it to conduct...},

@article{Li2008,
abstract = {A public database system archiving a direct numerical simulation (DNS) data set of isotropic, forced turbulence is described in this paper. The data set consists of the DNS output on 1024 3 spatial points and 1024 time samples spanning about one large-scale turnover time. This complete 1024 4 spacetime history of turbulence is accessible to users remotely through an interface that is based on the Web-services model. Users may write and execute analysis programs on their host computers, while the programs make subroutine-like calls that request desired parts of the data over the network. The users are thus able to perform numerical experiments by accessing the 27 terabytes (TB) of DNS data using regular platforms such as laptops. The architecture of the database is explained, as are some of the locally defined functions, such as differentiation and interpolation. Test calculations are performed to illus-trate the usage of the system and to verify the accuracy of the methods. The database is then used to analyze a dynamical model for small-scale intermittency in turbulence. Specif-ically, the dynamical effects of pressure and viscous terms on the Lagrangian evolution of velocity increments are evaluated using conditional averages calculated from the DNS data in the database. It is shown that these effects differ considerably among themselves and thus require different modeling strategies in Lagrangian models of velocity increments and intermittency.},

abstract = {We describe a new environment for the exploration of turbulent flows that uses a cluster of databases to store complete histories of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) results. This allows for spatial and temporal exploration of high-resolution data that were traditionally too large to store and too computationally expensive to produce on demand. We perform analysis of these data directly on the databases nodes, which minimizes the volume of network traffic. The low network demands enable us to provide public access to this experimental platform and its datasets through Web services. This paper details the system design and implementation. Specifically, we focus on hierarchical spatial indexing, cache-sensitive spatial scheduling of batch workloads, localizing computation through data partitioning, and load balancing techniques that minimize data movement. We provide real examples of how scientists use the system to perform high-resolution turbulence research from standard desktop computing environments.},

abstract = {We describe a method for evaluating computational turbulence queries, including Lagrange Polynomial interpolation, based on partial sums that allows the underlying data to be accessed in any order and in parts. We exploit these properties to stream data from disk in a single pass and concurrently evaluate batch queries. The combination of sequential I/O and data sharing improves performance by an order of magnitude when compared with direct evaluation of each query. The technique also supports distributed evaluation of queries in a database cluster, assembling the partial sums from each node at the query mediator. Interpolation is fundamental to computational turbulence, over 95{\%} of queries use these routines, and the partial sums method allows the JHU Turbulence Database Cluster to realize scale and throughput for our scientists' data-intensive workloads.},
