Contained here are the barycentric weights for the TDB channel flow
database. The files "baryctrwt-x-<LAG>.dat" and "baryctrwt-z-<LAG>.dat" contain
the interpolation weights for the x and z directions, respectively, where <LAG>
is either lag4, lag6, or lag8. For the x and z directions a single set of
weights are given for each Lagrangian interpolation method.

The files "baryctrwt-y-<LAG>.dat" are column formatted files with the columns given
as:
    j   - cell index
    j_o - offset index for calculating j_s near the boundaries
    j_s - starting index for the stencil
    j_e - ending index for the stencil
    w   - weights (number of columns: q = j_e - j_s + 1)

Also included are the differencing matrices for the first derivatives in the

    baryctrwt-diffmat-x-r-1-<FD>.dat
    baryctrwt-diffmat-z-r-1-<FD>.dat
    baryctrwt-diffmat-y-r-1-<FD>.dat

files where <FD> is either fd4, fd6, or fd8. The differencing matrices for the
second derivatives are in the
       
    baryctrwt-diffmat-x-r-2-<FD>.dat
    baryctrwt-diffmat-z-r-2-<FD>.dat
    baryctrwt-diffmat-y-r-2-<FD>.dat

files. The formatting for the differencing matrix files in the y direction is
given as:
    j   - grid point index
    j_o - offset index for calculating j_s near the boundaries
    j_s - starting index for the stencil
    j_e - ending index for the stencil
    D   - differencing matrix values (number of columns: q = j_e - j_s + 1)

The program used to generate the files is also included and is called
"channel_baryctrwt.c".
