---- Summary -----------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains a set of functions that provide a wrapper around
Matlab-Fast-SOAP, for querying data from the Johns Hopkins University
Turbulence Database Cluster. All communication with the JHU Turbulence
Database Cluster is provided through the TurbulenceService Matlab class which
uses Matlab-Fast-SOAP to create SOAP messages, query the Turbulence Database,
and parse the results. For each database function a wrapper has been created
to perform the data translation and retrieval.

More information can be found at: http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/help/


---- Getting Started ---------------------------------------------------------

A sample Matlab program is provided by turbm.m. To use simply run this program
from Matlab. In this program the usage of each Turbulence Database function is
illustrated. The program will sample each quantity (i.e. velocity, velocity
gradient, etc.) at 10 locations. The returned values will be written to
screen. The sample program also generates a contour surface of the velocity
magnitude at a random z-plane location.

User specific programs may be created by simply extending the sample program
as needed.


---- Matlab-Fast-SOAP package ------------------------------------------------

This package comes with a copy of Matlab-Fast-SOAP. Matlab-Fast-SOAP is
required for performing requests on the database. Turbmat tries to
automatically detect the location and version of Matlab-Fast-SOAP by looking
at the content of Turbmat's root path. If Turbmat is able to find
Matlab-Fast-SOAP, it will include its path, so that the modified
callSoapService(), createSoapMessage() and parseSoapResponse() functions
become available. If it cannot find Matlab-Fast-SOAP, it will throw an error.


---- Authentication Token ----------------------------------------------------

While our service is open to anyone, we would like to keep track of who is
using the service, and how. To this end, we would like each user or site to
obtain an authorization token from us:
http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/help/authtoken.html

If you are just experimenting, the default token included in these test files
(having a maximum of 4096 points per request) should be valid.


---- Platform-specific notes -------------------------------------------------

This interface been tested on newer installations of Matlab on various
flavors of Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows.


---- Error Handling ----------------------------------------------------------

Error handling is performed by the Matlab SOAP communication calls. If a 
SOAP error occurs during execution of the interface functions, all SOAP 
error information will be display to the Matlab terminal and the execution 
will be terminated. We do not currently provide a method for explicit error 
handling/catching.
